VYou row vigourously.  Suddenly, the waves seem much higher than before!  You keep rowing and aiming toward shore but it has suddenly become much more difficult, with the water churning and falling.  Just as you think you've got it made, the waves cause the boat to fall, and as it hits the water it smashes in to little pieces!\u000a\u000aWithout thinking about it, you swim towards the island.  You are surprised how quickly you find land - you must have been closer than you thought.  You walk up on to the beach.  It's not so cold that you fear for your life, and you attempt to make sense of the situation.  <<set $travel=1>>\u000a\u000a<<display 'On The Beach'>>
