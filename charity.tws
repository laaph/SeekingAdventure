VThis game was created for the [[Charity Game Jam|http://charitygamejam.com]]. I have a lot of charities I'd like to support, but I am going to mention two for this game.  If you don't like the ones I am drawing attention to, perhaps go to the [[Charity Game Jam web page|http://charitygamejam.com]] and choose one from their list to donate to?\u000a\u000a[[The Electronic Frontier Foundation|http://supporters.eff.org/donate]] has been around for as long as anyone on the internet remembers, but I personally feel they keep fighting the good fight.  Hopefully this isn't too political.\u000a\u000a[[The Museum of Art and Digital Entertainment|http://themade.org/donate]] not only provides a history museum of gaming, but also education.  The MADE teaches free classes to chidren in programming and writing, hosts game jams, and you can visit and play video games!  Disclaimer:  most of this game was written at the MADE while I was abusing it as my own personal office.\u000a\u000aOkay, I lied.  Here is another charity for your consideration.\u000a\u000a[[The International Dark-Sky Association|http://www.darksky.org/joinnow]] is a group that attempts to draw attention to the effects of light at night towards astronomy, animals and ecosystems, and humans.  By promoting information (such as merely making your night-time lights face the ground rather than at the sky) and protecting dark areas, it is possible to see the stars and save energy.  I hope this one isn't too political too.  I also hope it isn't too fringe.

V$f is used to indicate if the dragon starts a fight with the player.  $f is set to false whenever the dragon isn't in the same room; $f is set to true if the dragon is in the same room, and if $f is set to true when the dragon starts in the same room, combat will occur.\u000a\u000a$o is used to indicate that the dragon has moved.  This keeps him from running around in circles, as he will do if this is not kept track of.
